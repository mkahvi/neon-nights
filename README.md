# Neon Nights color theme for VSCode

Hacked up Outrun-inspired color theme. Not great, but better than default.

For personal use, but here publicly because lol why not.

## Install?

Uh. I dunno? Put it in vscode extensions as `mkahvi.neon-nights-0.0.1`? It might work?

## Credits

Based on [Synthwave '84 by Robb Owen](<https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode>) which is probably superior to this. But I disliked how washed out the background was so I darkened it up for better contrast, and made some other things pop out a bit more. And made some other things more muted. So a few tweaks here and there. Didn't take their glow functions and whatnot tho.
